# FLOW TRACKER
 

## Description
This is a software used to create Projects, assign users to Projects, and enable users to create Tickets for the projects they are assigned to.<br />
The software also includes user management and project management functionalities<br />
A user can be an Admin, a Project Manager, a Developer or a Submitter<br />
<br />
Example (high level): <br />
A company needs to build a new website for a client. <br />
A new Project is created. Chosen personnel is assigned to the Project, and a specific role is assigned to each user. <br />
Users will then be able to submit tickets related to the Project they are working on, and everything will be tracked by the software. <br />
Tickets can be assigned to specific developers or projects, and can include a priotity status, comments, attachements, etc. <br />
<br />
Before starting this project, I have written an SRS (in the /public folder) that includes further details as well as the development Sprints schedule.<br />
